# C structures

## Description
This is a collection of data structures written in C.
It is not meant to be a complete collection of all possible structures, but rather a collection of structures that I have found elemental. From these structures then anyone should be able to create more complex structures (queues, stacks, graphs, etc).
From time to time I will add more structures to this collection.

## Contents
* Linked List
* Binary Tree
* Hash Table

## How to run
To compile the code you can use the following command in the root directory of the project:
```
make
```
This will compile all the code and create an executable called `main`. To run the executable just type:
```bash
./main
```

If you want to clean the directory from the compiled files you can use:
```
make clean
```
